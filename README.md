***Project Description: 

In this stage youâ€™ll build the core experience of your movies app.

Your app will:

1) Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
2) Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
    -The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
3) Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
    - original title
    - movie poster image thumbnail
    - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
    - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
    - release date

Libraries/APIs used: 

- themoviedb.org 
- Picasso 

***Comments: At this point the main functionality of the application is implemented, however the UI and User features need a lot of work, 
this will be accomplished in Popular Movies Stage 2. 

***Special Thanks to Udacity and Udacity Reviewers for providing useful feedback and suggestions on improvements and further learning.
